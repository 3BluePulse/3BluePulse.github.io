#### Week1 
In the first week, during discussions with Professor Ning Dayong, we identified two potential directions for the graduation project. One idea is to design an underwater robot with a maritime focus, and the other is to develop a device capable of detecting internal engine faults through acoustic analysis.

This week, our group and the tutor had the second discussion on the graduation design, and initially determined that the plan was an underwater robot. In this discussion, we have made a general idea of the structure and control of the robot, and the summary is shown in the following diagram.
